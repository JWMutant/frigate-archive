# Overview

Frigate Archive is a production-tested archive system designed specifically for **Frigate running on Unraid**.

It automatically moves completed recordings from fast recording storage to long-term archive storage while safely maintaining the Frigate SQLite database.

Unlike simple file-copy scripts, Frigate Archive performs integrity verification before removing recordings and keeps Frigate's database synchronized throughout the process.

---

# Why Frigate Archive?

As Frigate installations grow, recording drives eventually fill up.

Many users manually move recordings to another disk, but doing so often leaves:

- orphaned database records
- incorrect storage statistics
- broken timeline entries
- missing previews
- inconsistent recording history

Frigate Archive automates the entire process safely.

# Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JWMutant/frigate-archive.git
```

Move into the project:

```bash
cd frigate-archive
```

Run the installer:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

---

# Configuration

Copy the example configuration if required:

```bash
cp config.conf.example config.conf
```

Edit:

```bash
nano config.conf
```

Configure:

- Recording location
- Archive location
- Frigate container
- Database location
- Archive thresholds

---

# First Run

Leave:

```bash
TEST_MODE=true
```

Run:

```bash
bash archive.sh
```

Review the output.

Once satisfied:

```bash
TEST_MODE=false
```

---

# Health Check

Validate the installation at any time:

```bash
bash healthcheck.sh
```

Example:

```text
Overall Status: HEALTHY
```

---

# Safety Guarantees

Frigate Archive never removes recordings until:

- Archive transfer completes successfully
- Verification confirms all files exist
- Database cleanup succeeds
- SQLite transaction commits successfully

If any stage fails, the archive process stops immediately.

---

# Tested On

- Unraid 7.3.1
- Frigate 0.17.x
- NVIDIA GPU
- Multiple cameras
- Production recording environments
- Existing archive destinations
- Fresh archive destinations
